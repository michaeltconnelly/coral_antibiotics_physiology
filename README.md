# *Pocillopora* coral antibiotics physiology 
These scripts and data are for the analysis of physiology (IPAM fluorometry and respirometry), transcriptome and microbiome data for the publication "**Antibiotics reduce *Pocillopora* coral-associated bacteria diversity, alter holobiont physiology, and activate immune gene expression**".

Raw bacteria 16S amplicon sequences and RNAseq data are deposited in the NBCI SRA under BioProject [PRJNA818888](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA818888/).

![Fig. 1: (a) Map of Panama depicting the collection locations of the fourteen Pocillopora genotypes used in the experiment, and the proportions of different mtORF types from each location. (b) Haplotype networks of the mtORF region for the Pocillopora genotypes used in the antibiotics experiment. Five unique haplotypes (I – V) were detected in an 828-bp alignment, corresponding to Pocillopora Type 1 (orange) and Type 3 (cyan) sensu Pinzón and LaJeunesse (2011). (c) Representative images of Pocillopora microfragments from each genotype on the first day of the experiment, outlines are colored according to mtORF type, and dominant symbiont type (C/D) is indicated in parentheses. All genotypes in the first row of images were used in transcriptome analyses.](./Fig1.png)
