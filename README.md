# coral_antibiotics_physiology
These scripts are for the analysis of physiology (IPAM fluorometry and respirometry), transcriptome and microbiome data for the publication "Antibiotics reduce coral-associated bacteria diversity and alter holobiont physiology in Panamanian *Pocillopora* corals".

Raw bacteria 16S amplicon sequences are deposited in the NBCI SRA under BioProject PRJNA818888

*Pocillopora* mtORF barcode sequences are deposited in GenBank 

![Fig. 1: Figure 1: (A) Map of Panama depicting the collection locations of the fourteen Pocillopora genotypes used the experiment, and the proportions of different mtORF types from each location. (B) Haplotype networks of the mtORF region for the Pocillopora genotypes used in the antibiotics experiment. Six unique haplotypes (I – VI) were detected in an 828-bp alignment, corresponding to Pocillopora Type 1 (orange) and Type 3 (cyan) sensu Pinzón and LaJeunesse (2011). (C) Representative images of Pocillopora microfragments from each genotype on the first day of the experiment. Images outlines are colored according to mtORF type, and the genotypes in the second row were those used in the RNAseq analyses.](./Fig1.png)
